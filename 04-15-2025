Today in class we got deeper into what media converters, repeaters, hub, switches, bridges, and WAP are and the pros and cons of them and what role they play in a network 
then we went into switch port configuration and what tools are used to do so 
then after lunch we did labs on setting up networks and troubleshooting them
