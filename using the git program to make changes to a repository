Today in class we learned how to modify a file in github using our unbuntu vmware work station using the git programing language 
we first had to install git in order to complete what mr derrick wanted us to do
we then verified who we were by using the ls or pwd command 
we then had to create a new file on gethub as a test file 
after we created a new file we then generated a classic token for that because we had to use it later in order to modif said file on git hub
we then used the git command 
then we had to make a github directory 
then we navigated to the git hub directory that we just created 
while in that directory we used this syntax git config --global user.email "occs.spatton@gmail.com" to sign in to git hub on our work station
then we put in our user name using a similar syntax using username.name instead of user.email
then we had to make a clone of the repository from git hub onto the work station 
we then creatd a line in the file that we created inside of the directory 
then we used the git add . command to make changes to the repository
then we used the the git commit command to commit our changes 
then we used the git push comand to finalize our changes
